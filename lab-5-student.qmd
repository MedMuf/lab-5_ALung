For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

-   Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
-   Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
-   Use good code formatting practices.
-   Comment your code.
-   Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.

## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

#### Description of the Crime

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

crime_scene_report |>
  filter(date == "20180115" & 
           city == "SQL City" & 
           type == "murder") |>
  select(description)

#Two witnesses from footage.
#One lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr".
#The other, Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave". 

```

#### Witness Interviews

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-witnesses

suspects <- person |> 
  filter(address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr") |>
  arrange(desc(address_number)) |>
  slice(1)

suspects <- person |>
  mutate(First_name = str_split(name, " ", simplify = TRUE)[,1]) |>
  filter(First_name == "Annabel"  & address_street_name == "Franklin Ave") |>
  full_join(suspects) |>
  subset(select =  -First_name)

suspects

interview |>
  filter(person_id %in% suspects$id) 

#Witnesses are Annabel Miller, ID: 16371 and Morty Schapiro, ID: 14887

#Shapiro saw a man run out with a "Get Fit Now" gym bag, number started with "48Z".
#These bags are only given to gold members and got in a car with a plate that included "H42W".

#Miller saw the murder happen and recognized the killer, who worked out last week on January 9th. 
```

#### Suspect Determination

```{r}
#| label: suspect
 
drivers_license |> 

#Rename id in drivers id to prevent confusion.
  rename(drivers_id = id) |>

#Search for plates that have this pattern. 
  filter(str_detect(plate_number, "H42W")) |>

#Join data to consolidate information of suspect. 
  inner_join(person,
             by = join_by(
               drivers_id == license_id
             )) |>
  inner_join(get_fit_now_member,
             by = join_by(
               id == person_id
             )) |>
  rename(gym_id = id.y) |>
  inner_join(get_fit_now_check_in,
             by = join_by(
               gym_id == membership_id
             )) |>
  rename(person_name = name.x) |>
  
#Select columns of interest to verify suspect meets criteria given from witnesses. 
  select(plate_number,
         person_name,
         id,
         gym_id,
         membership_status,
         check_in_date)

#Murderer is Jeremy Bowers as described by the witnesses
```

#### Suspect Confession

```{r}
#| label: suspect-interview

interview |>
  filter(person_id == "67318")

#Suspect was hired by a women with a lot of money.
#She is around 5'55" (65") or 5'7" (67"), red hair, drives a Tesla Model S.
#She attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017

```

#### Determine Associate

```{r}
#Determine if anyone fits the description given by Bowers

#Starting with the facebook event dataset to find the id's of those that went 3 times to
#the SQL Symphony Concert. 

facebook_event_checkin |>
  filter(event_name == "SQL Symphony Concert" &
           str_starts(date, "201712")) |>
  group_by(person_id) |>
  summarise(num_of_visits = n()) |>
  filter(num_of_visits == "3") 
  
#Use the id's that we got (24556 and 99716) to determine if they match Bowers 
#given physical descriptions.

drivers_license |>
  
  filter(hair_color == "red" & 
           car_model == "Model S" & 
           height >= "65" &
           height <= "67"  
           ) |>
  rename(drivers_id = id) |>
  
  inner_join(person,
             by = join_by(
               drivers_id == license_id
             )) |>
  inner_join(income,
             join_by(ssn)) |>
  
  filter(id == "99716" |
           id == "24556") |>
  
#Select columns of interest to verify Bowers description of employer is correct.
  select(name,
         id,
         height,
         hair_color,
         gender,
         car_model,
         annual_income)

#Miranda Priestly matches the description and activity given by Bowers and has 
#an income that would prove the purchase of a hitman possible. 


```

**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.** Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!

## And the final suspect is...
